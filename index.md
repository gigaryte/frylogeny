The humble potato plays a central role in the diets of people around the globe.
This page is our attempt to classify and characterize the myriad ways in which
humanity has seen fit to prepare the beloved starchy tuber for consumption. As
with taxonomy of biological organisms, our understanding of frylogeny is
constantly evolving, and as such, this is a living document.

There are two general potato preparation categories - *whole* and *cut* - and
a miscellaneous, catch-all category for those potato varietals that defy our
current understanding of potato preparation categorization.
